=head1 NAME

kb_SPAdes::kb_SPAdesClient

=head1 DESCRIPTION


A KBase module: kb_SPAdes
A wrapper for the SPAdes assembler with hybrid features supported.
http://bioinf.spbau.ru/spades

Always runs in careful mode.
Runs 3 threads / CPU.
Maximum memory use is set to available memory - 1G.
Autodetection is used for the PHRED quality offset and k-mer sizes.
A coverage cutoff is not specified.

=item Description

Input parameters for running SPAdes.
workspace_name - the name of the workspace from which to take input
                 and store output.
output_contigset_name - the name of the output contigset
read_libraries - a list of Illumina PairedEndLibrary files in FASTQ or BAM format.
dna_source - (optional) the source of the DNA used for sequencing 'single_cell': DNA
                 amplified from a single cell via MDA anything else: Standard
                 DNA sample from multiple cells. Default value is None.
min_contig_length - (optional) integer to filter out contigs with length < min_contig_length
                 from the SPAdes output. Default value is 0 implying no filter.
kmer_sizes - (optional) K-mer sizes, Default values: 33, 55, 77, 99, 127
                 (all values must be odd, less than 128 and listed in ascending order)
                 In the absence of these values, K values are automatically selected.
skip_error_correction - (optional) Assembly only (No error correction).
                 By default this is disabled.

=head2 HybridSPAdesParams

=over 4



=item Description

------To run HybridSPAdes 3.13.0 you need at least one library of the following types:------
1) Illumina paired-end/high-quality mate-pairs/unpaired reads
2) IonTorrent paired-end/high-quality mate-pairs/unpaired reads
3) PacBio CCS reads
Version 3.13.0 of SPAdes supports paired-end reads, mate-pairs and unpaired reads.
SPAdes can take as input several paired-end and mate-pair libraries simultaneously.

workspace_name - the name of the workspace from which to take input
                 and store output.
output_contigset_name - the name of the output contigset
read_libraries - a list of Illumina or IonTorrent paired-end/high-quality mate-pairs/unpaired reads
long_reads_libraries - a list of PacBio, Oxford Nanopore Sanger reads and/or additional contigs
dna_source - the source of the DNA used for sequencing 'single_cell': DNA
                 amplified from a single cell via MDA anything else: Standard
                 DNA sample from multiple cells. Default value is None.
pipeline_options - a list of string specifying how the SPAdes pipeline should be run
kmer_sizes - (optional) K-mer sizes, Default values: 21, 33, 55, 77, 99, 127
                 (all values must be odd, less than 128 and listed in ascending order)
                 In the absence of these values, K values are automatically selected.
min_contig_length - integer to filter out contigs with length < min_contig_length
                 from the HybridSPAdes output. Default value is 0 implying no filter.
@optional dna_source
@optional pipeline_options
@optional kmer_sizes
@optional min_contig_length
